Class1 notes
1. Git is a distributed version control model. Which means
you have local and remote repositories. You always work with your local repo and only push the final changes to remote. so you dont need to be connected to network to work with GIT

2. you always do operations to your local repo and finally when you want to sync with remote you do the command -> git push origin

3. commands of a basic git life cycle you can run in local repo

     git clone <repourl> -> To clone a remote repo into a local workspace

     git branch -a -> List all branches in the remote

     git branch -> tells which branch are you in

     git checkout <branch> -> workspace will switch to the branch you specified

     git add <filename> -> to add files before commit to your local repo

     git status -> gives info about all modified files in your workspace

     git diff -> shows in the output all the lines in the modified files

     git commit -m " bla bla bla" -> command to commit files to local git repo

     git push origin -> command to sync local with remote repo

Class 2 Notes
     To create a new branch and push this branch to origin
     	git checkout -b <branchname>  ---> This creates branch in your local
		git push --set-upstream origin <newbranch>  ---> This will put your branch in remote repo
     	Do all operations like add files etc ..
     	finally do git push origin <branchname>
   
     To merge first checkout the branch that  you want to merge to
     and then run below command by specifiying the branch you want to merge from
         git checkout master
         git merge Release_oct2017
         git commit -m "merged branch Release_oct2017 into master"
         git push origin

     git log -> This command gives you the history of all commits done on a branch

     git blame - To know the changes done by each committer in the group to a file

     Q. What are branching strategies in your project
     Ans. 

	 git pull --> to get the changes checked in by someone else
	 If we dont have the latest and if we try to commit our files - it will inform
